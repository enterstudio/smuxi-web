question="How do I connect to SSL/TLS enabled IRC servers using stunnel?"
answer="""
First install the stunnel4 package:

    sudo apt-get install stunnel4

Provide a stunnel config file:

    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/stunnel/irc-freenode.conf
    pid = /var/run/stunnel4/irc-freenode.pid
    setuid = stunnel4
    setgid = stunnel4
    CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    verify = 2

    [irc]
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:6667
    connect = irc.freenode.net:6697
    EOF

Restart the stunnel4 service:

    sudo service stunnel4 restart

Now you need to tell Smuxi to connect to host 127.0.0.1 port 6667 in the
settings of the IRC server. (Server -> Manage -> select an IRC server -> Edit)

Connect to the updated IRC server. After the connection was established you can
check if you are connected using SSL/TLS by doing a /whois your own nick, e.g.:

    /whois meebey

This will show the following output:

    -!- meebey [~smuxi@123.123.123.123]
    -!-  realname: Mirco Bauer
    -!-  server: karatkievich.freenode.net [Montreal, CA, NA]
    [671 (?) meebey] is using a secure connection
    [378 (?) meebey] is connecting from *@123.123.123.123
    -!-  idle: 6 [signon: 1/9/2017 4:08:03 PM]
    -!-  End of /WHOIS list.

The "[671 (?) meebey3] is using a secure connection" line is the interesting
one. It means we are connected using SSL/TLS.
