[[!meta title="""Smuxi 1.0 with message persistence, counters """]]

And here we go again! We're proud to announce the new version of Smuxi, release
1.0 "***Finally***". During the development, [NN bug reports][bugs] and
[NN feature requests][features] in [NN commits][commits] were worked on making
this release a MAJOR_OR_MINOR feature and bugfix release.

### Finally 1.0 ###

Smuxi is celebrating its 10th anniversary! 10 years ago, [Mirco Bauer made the
first commit][first-commit] to the Smuxi source code repository and is still
very committed to it. He started the Gnosmirc project in 2005 when the only way
a 24/7 "always-on" experience with IRC meant you had to use a console based IRC
client like bitchx, irssi or epic combined with screen and SSH. This looks very
practical at first and is a powerful Unix-ish way of accomplishing that job, but
it has the big downside that it doesn't integrate with a desktop environment
like GNOME. A bit later the [Gnosmirc project got renamed][rename] to Smuxi when
the new code architecture allowed other frontend implementations besides the
GNOME one.

## Changes since Smuxi 0.11 ##

### Message Persistence ###

One if the biggest drawbacks of the IRC protocol ever was that messages can't be
retrieved from the IRC server because the IRC server is simply relaying messages
to the connected clients. So, if an IRC client is freshly started and connects
it starts to receive new messages, but all message you had received before are
no longer available. This always made IRC in a way "volatile" unlike other
communication systems like email where messages are relayed and stored on the
client side. One common approach for IRC clients is to store log files in a text
file. This is a simple feature and gives the user the possibility to read older
conversations. Smuxi also supports text file logging like other IRC clients but
it has a big user experience drawback as you need to open the file from the disk
outside of the IRC client.

In Smuxi 1.0 messages sent and received are now stored on the disk in a way they
can automatically be retrieved/loaded when you restart Smuxi. It is like you
have never closed Smuxi! This feature was already available in Smuxi for some
time as a technical preview and it used the Db4o object database, but we were
never happy about the performance neither with the stability so it always stayed
an optional feature you need to enable. This year we tried a new message buffer
backend using the famous [SQLite][] database and it works much faster and stable
as a rock. So _finally_ we can enable this feature by default because it just
works and enhanced your experience. We hope you enjoy it.

Documentation of how you can change Smuxi message buffer backend and behavior
can be found [here][msgbuffer-docs].

### Scripting Enhancements ###

#### New Hook Points ####

Smuxi 1.0 supports with the following new [hook points][]:

 * engine/protocol-manager/on-presence-status-changed/ This hook point is raised
   when the presence status of a protocol manager changes. This happens for
   example when an IRC connection toggles the away state.
 * engine/session/on-event-message/ This hook point raises event messages that
   usually begin with "-!-". This can be useful to track state changes that are
   shown as a message without having a dedicated hook point for it.
 * engine/session/command-$cmd/ This hook point is raised on the engine side
   for commands, e.g. /some_command that isn't handled by the frontend or engine
   built-in commands. This is useful for commands that should be available for
   all frontends and isn't specific to the frontend environment.

 [hook points]: /documentation/hooks/#hookpoints

#### New Plugins ####

The following new plugins are supported by Smuxi 1.0:

 * [topic-diff][]: Shows the word differences of the topic after topic changes.
   (meebey)
 * [away-nick][]: Automatically appends and removes $AWAY_SUFFIX to/from the nick
   name when you go away using the /away command or by disconnecting all
   frontends from the smuxi-server. (meebey)
 * [system-info][]: Shows system info. Includes system kernel version, distro
   name, and CPU vendor information. (AK0)
 * [now-playing][]: This plugin is not new but was rewritten in Python to get
   rid of the spaghetti code monster which was written in Bash. (jamesaxl)
